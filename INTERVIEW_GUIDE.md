# Interview Guide: Thread-Safe LRU Cache

This guide provides structured talking points for both interviewers and candidates using this LRU Cache project.

## Project Overview (5 minutes)

### Key Points to Cover
- **Problem Statement**: Implement a thread-safe LRU cache for high-performance applications
- **Core Requirements**: Generic types, O(1) operations, thread safety, metrics
- **Real-World Context**: Used in databases, web servers, distributed systems

### Sample Introduction
"We need a caching layer that can handle concurrent requests while maintaining LRU eviction policy. The cache should support any key-value types and provide performance metrics for monitoring."

## Technical Deep Dive (20-30 minutes)

### 1. Data Structure Design

#### Discussion Points
```cpp
// Why this combination?
std::list<CacheEntry> lru_list_;                    // O(1) insertion/deletion
std::unordered_map<Key, Iterator> index_;           // O(1) lookup
```

**Questions to Explore:**
- Why not `std::vector` for the LRU list?
- How does `std::list` provide O(1) operations?
- What's the trade-off with memory overhead?
- Alternative: Could we use `std::deque`?

#### Expected Answers
- Lists provide O(1) insertion/deletion at any position
- Vectors require O(n) for middle insertions
- Memory overhead: extra pointers per node
- Cache locality considerations

### 2. Thread Safety Architecture

#### Discussion Points
```cpp
mutable std::shared_mutex cache_mutex_;
std::atomic<size_t> hit_count_{0};
```

**Questions to Explore:**
- Why `shared_mutex` instead of regular `mutex`?
- When do we use shared vs. exclusive locks?
- Why are metrics atomic?
- What about lock-free alternatives?

#### Expected Answers
- Reader-writer locks optimize for read-heavy workloads
- Multiple readers can proceed concurrently
- Atomic metrics avoid lock contention for counters
- Lock-free requires more complex memory management

### 3. Template Design

#### Discussion Points
```cpp
template<typename Key, typename Value, 
         typename Hash = std::hash<Key>,
         typename KeyEqual = std::equal_to<Key>>
class ThreadSafeLRUCache {
    static_assert(std::is_copy_constructible_v<Key>);
```

**Questions to Explore:**
- Why template parameters for Hash and KeyEqual?
- What do the static_asserts achieve?
- How does this compare to inheritance-based design?
- Performance implications?

#### Expected Answers
- Customizable for different key types
- Compile-time type checking
- Zero runtime overhead vs. virtual functions
- Better optimization opportunities

## Implementation Challenges (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Exception Safety

#### Code Example
```cpp
auto put(Key key, Value value) -> bool {
    std::unique_lock lock(cache_mutex_);
    
    auto it = index_.find(key);
    if (it != index_.end()) {
        it->second->value = std::move(value);  // Strong exception safety
        move_to_front_unsafe(it->second);
        return true;
    }
    
    evict_if_needed_unsafe();
    lru_list_.emplace_front(std::move(key), std::move(value));
    index_[lru_list_.front().key] = lru_list_.begin();
    return true;
}
```

**Discussion Points:**
- What happens if `std::move(value)` throws?
- How do we maintain invariants during exceptions?
- Why use RAII for lock management?

### 2. Move Semantics Optimization

#### Code Example
```cpp
// Efficient resource transfer
cache.put(std::move(expensive_key), std::move(large_value));
```

**Questions:**
- When is move semantics beneficial?
- How does this affect the API design?
- Performance implications?

### 3. Memory Management

**Discussion Points:**
- How do we prevent memory leaks?
- What about iterator invalidation?
- Custom allocators for performance?

## Advanced Topics (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Scalability Analysis

#### Current Limitations
```cpp
// Single lock limits scalability
std::unique_lock lock(cache_mutex_);  // Serializes all writes
```

**Improvement Strategies:**
- **Lock Striping**: Multiple locks for different hash buckets
- **Fine-Grained Locking**: Per-node locks
- **Lock-Free Approaches**: Hazard pointers, RCU

#### Sample Discussion
"How would you scale this to handle millions of operations per second?"

Expected approaches:
- Partition the cache (sharding)
- Use thread-local caches
- Implement lock-free data structures
- Consider NUMA topology

### 2. Performance Optimization

#### Current Bottlenecks
```cpp
// Potential optimization points
move_to_front_unsafe(it->second);     // List manipulation
total_access_time_ns_.fetch_add(...); // Atomic operations
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Batch operations to reduce lock overhead
- Use memory pools for allocation
- Optimize for CPU cache lines
- Profile-guided optimization

### 3. Production Considerations

#### Monitoring and Observability
```cpp
struct CacheMetrics {
    size_t hits, misses;
    double hit_ratio;
    double average_access_time_ns;
};
```

**Questions:**
- What other metrics would be valuable?
- How to integrate with monitoring systems?
- SLA considerations?

#### Configuration Management
- Runtime capacity adjustment
- Eviction policy selection
- Performance tuning parameters

## Testing Strategy (10 minutes)

### 1. Unit Testing Approach
```cpp
TEST_F(LRUCacheTest, LRUEvictionBehavior) {
    // Test specific eviction scenarios
}
```

### 2. Concurrency Testing
```cpp
TEST_F(ThreadSafetyTest, MixedOperations) {
    // Stress test with multiple threads
}
```

**Discussion Points:**
- How to test race conditions?
- Deterministic vs. stress testing
- Memory sanitizers and tools

## Real-World Applications (5-10 minutes)

### Use Cases
1. **Database Buffer Pool**: Page caching in PostgreSQL/MySQL
2. **Web Server**: HTTP response caching
3. **CDN**: Content distribution networks
4. **Application Layer**: ORM query result caching
5. **Distributed Systems**: Consistent hashing rings

### Integration Examples
```cpp
// Database integration
class DatabaseCache {
    ThreadSafeLRUCache<QueryKey, ResultSet> query_cache_{10000};
public:
    auto execute_query(const std::string& sql) -> ResultSet;
};

// Web server integration
class HTTPCache {
    ThreadSafeLRUCache<URL, Response> response_cache_{50000};
public:
    auto get_response(const Request& req) -> std::optional<Response>;
};
```

## Extension Ideas (5 minutes)

### Immediate Extensions
1. **TTL Support**: Time-based expiration
2. **Multiple Eviction Policies**: LFU, FIFO, Random
3. **Size-Based Eviction**: Memory usage limits
4. **Persistence**: Disk-backed storage

### Advanced Extensions
1. **Distributed Caching**: Network protocol
2. **Compression**: Transparent data compression
3. **Replication**: Multi-node consistency
4. **Hot/Cold Tiers**: Hierarchical storage
